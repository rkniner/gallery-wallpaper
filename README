	Gallery Wallpaper
	
	The Gallery Wallpaper is a Live Wallpaper for the Android operating
	system.  It is designed to replace the home screen background with
	images from your device's MediaStore, or built-in gallery storage.
	
	Compiling and installation of this program can be performed using
	Eclipse Platform (available at <http://www.eclipse.org/platform>)
	along with the Android SDK provided by Google (available at
	<http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html>).
	
	Once this project is compiled, the resulting .apk file can be loaded
	onto any unlocked Android device either by using the SDK-provided
	``adb'' executable, or by copying it onto the device's USB storage
	partition and using a file manager to run it.
